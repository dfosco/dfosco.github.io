##A technological exploration of reading

This work brings forward a historical research around the technologies of the book throughout history and its implications for readers and their societies — from the dawn of writing to the development of digital reading.

It was presented as a graduation project in the Communications - Publishing major at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in December 2013.

Unfortunately, it is not available in english (but it might be one day). The full text in portuguese can be downloaded below.
